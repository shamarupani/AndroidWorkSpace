It is a auto-generated file, which have pointer to all resources used in the application.

All resources located in res folder are mostly .xml files, which will not be understood by java compiler.
So aapt (android application packaging tool) will convert xml files and other resources into java file,
which has identification numbers (pointers) to all those resources. If we want to access any resource 
from the code, then we can access through this R.java file.
Full form is Resource.java file.
